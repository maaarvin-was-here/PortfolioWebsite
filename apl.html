Sensors or GPS trackers that are built into the robots themselves can never be relied upon due to the high risk of error, except when using extremely high-grade and expensive GPS systems.

                    However, robots operating underwater are unable to even utilize high-grade GPS systems due to the fact that GPS does not work underwater, especially at the depths that require robots to operate at. As such, using an external motion capture system is not just more reliable than on-board sensors, it’s the only feasible way to get an accurate measure of the robot’s movements. Additionally, underwater robots are prone to gradual underwater drift or unpredictable movements from currents.

            This project focused on the development of a motion tracking system which works underwater and is able to track the location and movements of a robot underwater. While underwater motion tracking systems already exist, they are very expensive, reaching prices of well over $100,000 (ahem Qualisys). To circumvent the cost issue, our system uses an array of Raspberry Pi cameras to monitor a location and triangulates the location of underwater robots using computer vision code. Ultimately, this system will serve as a more affordable yet functional version of a high-end underwater motion tracking system.
